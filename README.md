Full-stack Industrial Systems / Embedded / Python

I focus on industrial systems, cooling control, embedded development, and backend integration.  
Most of my daily work combines MCU / PLC control logic, Python backend services, web interfaces,  
and deployment or update flows for real-world systems.

---

## About

- Based in Taiwan, with a background in Computer Science and Information Engineering  
- University graduation project: timetabling system using a Genetic Algorithm  
- Currently working in industrial domains, dealing with cooling systems, test systems, and control platforms  
- Used to touching the whole stack:
  - MCU firmware on STM32, communication protocols such as Modbus RTU  
  - Python / Flask services, Redfish-style interfaces, Web UIs  
  - Linux environment setup, offline deployment, shell script automation  

Most company-related projects and code are private or kept in internal repositories,  
so this GitHub account mainly hosts personal practice, side projects, and experiments.

---

## Tech Stack

### Languages

- C / C++ (embedded development, MCU firmware)
- Python (Flask, scripts, tooling)
- JavaScript / TypeScript (mainly Next.js / React)
- LabVIEW (test automation, ATE flows)

### Embedded & Control

- STM32 family MCUs: UART, ADC, PWM, Timer, GPIO, and related peripherals  
- Communication: Modbus RTU, RS-485, general serial communication  
- I/O and industrial field work: DI/DO, fan control, sensor reading, protection logic  

### Backend / System

- Python + Flask for APIs, Web UIs, and control panels
- Linux / Ubuntu Server, systemd services, Nginx
- Shell scripts for automation, offline installation packages (wheelhouse, offline apt repositories)
- Basic Docker usage and CI/CD workflow design (mainly GitHub Actions)

### Frontend

- Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS
- Flask + Bootstrap 5
- Focused on tool-like system interfaces, readability, and practicality

## Selected Projects

### Timetabling Problem with Genetic Algorithm

University graduation project using a Genetic Algorithm to generate timetables.

- Models constraints such as courses, teachers, classrooms, and time slots  
- Implements selection, crossover, and mutation steps of GA  
- Visualizes generated timetables through a web interface

### guzzzi.com

Personal side project and playground for trying out full-stack ideas.

- Site: <https://guzzzi.com/>  
- Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, partially integrated with Firebase  
- Planned to be expanded with:
  - Technical articles and notes
  - Small tools (for example, query tools, practice APIs, and other utilities)

### Industrial / Private Projects (High-level Overview)

Most of these projects live in private Git servers or internal repositories,  
so only a high-level description is provided here:

- Industrial cooling control systems (CDU-style systems)  
- STM32 firmware, including Modbus RTU communication, ADC measurements, PWM control, digital I/O  
- Python backend services and Web UIs for monitoring, configuration, and firmware updates  
- Offline deployment and update mechanisms (offline packages, automation scripts, remote update flows)

---

## Current Focus

- Designing MCU bootloader and firmware update architectures that are safe and reusable  
- Building stable deployment flows for industrial environments, including rollback and offline update strategies  
- Structuring Python / Flask / Redfish-style backends in a more systematic way  
- Gradually strengthening knowledge in deep learning and data analysis  
  to apply on monitoring and anomaly detection in industrial systems
